## Overview

In this project, we build and evaluate predictive models to estimate housing prices in California. The goal is to use various features (such as median income, housing median age, total rooms, and location) to predict the median house value in different regions.

Key steps include:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns
- Feature engineering to enhance model performance
- Building regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Ensemble methods)
- Evaluating model performance using metrics like RMSE

This project is ideal for showcasing skills in data analysis, machine learning, and Python programming.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation and cleaning
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations
- **Scikit-learn** – for model building and evaluation
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – for data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for interactive coding and analysis

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project contains various attributes of California housing areas including:
- **Median Income**
- **Median House Value**
- **Housing Median Age**
- **Total Rooms**
- **Total Bedrooms**
- **Population**
- **Households**
- **Latitude and Longitude**

This dataset is publicly available and is a popular benchmark for housing price prediction tasks.
